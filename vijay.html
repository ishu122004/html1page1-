<p>he is always my favourite actor.On September 1, as President Anura Kumara Dissanayake arrived at Myliddy fisheries harbour in Jaffna, there were high expectations among the Tamil fishermen in the region. Clad in black trousers and a pale brown shirt, Anura arrived in style at the harbour premises once controlled by the Sri Lankan army.

In his usual firebrand style, Anura’s five-minute speech addressing the local businessmen and representatives of the fisher community in Myliddy caught everyone by surprise. After launching the fisheries harbour development project - phase 3 to support the livelihood of the war-affected fishermen, Anura said, “The government is committed to safeguarding the surrounding seas, islands, and landmass of the country for the benefit of the people and will not allow any external force to exert influence in this regard.”</p>
